      "      Today especially my butt seems to have formed a perfect mold of my chair. I worked through lunch due to a high level mouse requesting ridiculous data. Why the bottom must suffer for the top I'll  never get, shouldn't it be the other way around. I mean, if I made 6 figures I would have no problem parking my 745 BMW myself--actually I'd prefer to park it myself. But here at Disney, the big shots not only get a car allowance every month to help pay for their beauties but they get their cars valet'd everyday. Yes that's right. The rest of us, not in the preferred mouse club, must circle around the parking structure finding the widest compact parking space so our \"un-luxury\" cars don't get more dings.  Really, the more you get paid the fewer the benefits you should receive. It is those of us that don't get paid 6 figures who should get the benefits to make up for the limited funds. (Those of you who don't make bank and are far from it will completely agree I'm sure. And when I make 6 figures--yes I said when--I'm won't agree with me.)  So life is good right now. The poor soul who has bought my old car rescued me from financial debt this month, I have two job opportunities on the horizon, Hannah is coming home in 13 days, the girls and I are going to party our asses off in Vegas in two weeks, and I have 2 dates this weekend. I'm not sure what it is in LA but I've never dated so much in my life. You'd think that you'd date the most in college, well this has proven not to be true for most. I think I went on like 3 formal dates in college total. The \"lets hang out at my house\" offers came up way  more often than the \"lets go out, eat dinner, talk and get to know each other...\"  It can't help that many of the boys, yes boys, I met were at the club. What do I expect if our first interaction is my ass and their crotch? Funny though, we always tried NOT to meet men at the club but for some reason most of the guys there are trying to meet a girl. (I'm sure many of you are like, duhhhh) Note: there's a reason the music is loud a the club...I'm not trying to talk to you I'm trying to dance with you or avoid you.   I'm moving in January, please start praying now because I'll need all the help I can get. I have more stuff than I even know of and moving 5 times in the last 5 years hasn't taught me anything about getting rid of things or not buying more things. Issues...Kim I need you help!!!  Ta Ta for now...my random thoughts have subsided. Oh, FYI--I've discovered why my ass is getting fatter working here. Today I didn't spend a dime and just munched on Disney food. This is what I ate: a bagel (wheat...only healthy thing all day) half with Peanut Butter and half with Cream Cheese, 5 small raspberry jam cookies, a Balance Bar, 1/3 of a cinnamon roll, and half a roast beef sandwich and I've been sitting here all day except for the walk to the kitchen, 2 trips to the bathroom, and 1 to the sink. YA MAN....I'm one sexy bitch!  (I did drink green tea which is mucho good for me) \n",
